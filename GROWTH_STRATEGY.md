This playbook outlines a comprehensive, legitimate, and sustainable developer adoption and search optimization strategy for **`family-tree-svg`**.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Competitive Advantage

### The Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
> *"Instead of rendering family trees as rigid corporate org charts (gray boxes and circuit-board straight lines), `family-tree-svg` renders genealogies as living, organic trees — complete with calligraphic trunks, natural curving boughs, and distinct botanical leaf species (Ginkgo, Oak, Birch, Maple, Linden, Laurel, Oval) — with zero UI clutter, 100% vector SVG scalability, and an MIT open-source license."*

### Competitor Differentiation Matrix

| Factor | `family-tree-svg` | BALKAN FamilyTreeJS | family-chart (D3) | relatives-tree |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Visual Aesthetic** | **Living botanical tree with branches & leaves** | Corporate org-chart boxes & wires | Rectangular cards & orthogonal connectors | Headless layout coordinates only |
| **Pricing / License** | **100% Free & Open Source (MIT)** | Commercial license ($$$$) / Proprietary | Freemium / Proprietary | MIT |
| **Zero Dependencies** | **Yes (0 runtime deps)** | Heavy bundled library | Requires D3 ecosystem | Yes |
| **Vector SVG Export** | **Native standalone `.svg` download** | Requires paid tier or Canvas render | Custom export code needed | None |
| **Botanical Anatomy** | **7 Leaf Shapes, 4 Trunks, 4 Branch Styles** | None | None | None |
| **TypeScript Support**| **Built-in `src/index.d.ts`** | Built-in | Community / Partial | Built-in |

- [ ] **Publish Tutorial 1 (DEV.to & Hashnode)**:
  - Title: *"How to Build an Organic Family Tree in JavaScript with SVG"*
  - Target Intent: `how to create a family tree in javascript`
  - Outline: The problem with boxy diagrams, recursive JSON data structure, rendering Bezier branches, styling botanical leaves, exporting SVG.
- [ ] **Engage in Community Forums**:
  - Monitor Reddit (`r/genealogy`, `r/webdev`, `r/javascript`) for threads discussing genealogy visualization tools.
  - Monitor Stack Overflow for questions tagged `family-tree`, `genealogy`, `svg` with constructive code snippets.
- [ ] **Create GitHub Release v1.1.1**:
  - Publish with clean `package.json`, bundled TypeScript typings, and reduced tarball size.

### Days 61 – 90: Authority, Backlinks & Ecosystem Integrations
- [ ] **Show HN Launch (Hacker News)**:
  - Title: *"Show HN: FamilyTreeSVG – Pure organic SVG family trees with trunks and botanical leaves"*

## 4. Search Content Strategy (High-Value Technical Articles)

### Article 1: "How to Build a Family Tree with SVG in JavaScript"
- **Primary Keyword**: `family tree javascript svg`
- **Secondary Keywords**: `javascript genealogy visualization`, `svg family tree tutorial`, `family tree generator javascript`
- **Target Search Intent**: Informational & developer implementation guide.
- **Key Sections**:
  1. Why tree hierarchies present unique layout challenges compared to standard DAGs.
  2. Structuring family data in nested JSON.
  3. Generating smooth SVG paths with Bezier curves.
  4. Adding interactive zoom, pan, and vector export.
  5. Live CodeSandbox demo link and npm package mention.

### Article 2: "Why Most Family Tree Diagrams Look Like Org Charts (And How to Fix It)"
- **Primary Keyword**: `organic family tree visualization`
- **Secondary Keywords**: `botanical family tree`, `artistic family tree javascript`, `pedigree chart design`
- **Target Search Intent**: Design, visualization aesthetics, and modern alternatives.
- **Key Sections**:
  1. The historical shift from hand-drawn biological trees to 1990s corporate org charts.
  2. Botanical leaf anatomy: modeling Ginkgo, Oak, and Linden leaves in vector geometry.

## 5. Legitimate Community Outreach Guidelines (Zero-Spam Policy)

### Principles for Developer Forums
1. **Value First, Links Second**: Always answer the developer's core technical question with complete, functional code or algorithmic explanation.
2. **Disclose Authorship Transparently**: Always state *"Disclaimer: I created `family-tree-svg`..."* when mentioning the library.
3. **Only Post When Relevant**: Never post on unrelated threads or unsolicited forums.

### Example Stack Overflow / Reddit Response
> *"If you want an organic biological tree appearance rather than traditional rectangular boxes and straight lines, you can use `family-tree-svg`. It renders living trunks and botanical leaf shapes directly as scalable SVG from nested JSON data. Here is a minimal example using vanilla JavaScript:*
>
> ```javascript
> import FamilyTreeSVG from 'family-tree-svg';
> 
> const tree = FamilyTreeSVG.create('#container', data, {
>   leafStyle: 'ginkgo',
>   trunkStyle: 'earth_roots'
> });
> tree.fitView();
> ```
> *(Disclaimer: I am the maintainer of this open-source package).*
