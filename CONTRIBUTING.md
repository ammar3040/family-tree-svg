# Contributing to FamilyTreeSVG

2. **Clone your fork**:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/family-tree-svg.git

## Development Guidelines

- **Zero Heavy Dependencies**: The core package is deliberately lightweight and dependency-free. Avoid adding runtime external dependencies.
- **Organic Aesthetic Integrity**: When adding new trunk, branch, or leaf styles, ensure they follow smooth Bezier curvature and biological inspiration.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Never introduce breaking changes to existing methods (`create`, `fitView`, `setColors`, `exportSVG`, `loadData`, `destroy`).
- **TypeScript Definitions**: If you modify the public API, update `src/index.d.ts` to match.
